     <p><h1>Phyllo Shell</h1></p>
    <p>Phyllo is a very thin dough used for making delicious pastries such as baklava, spanakopita, or Albanian pie (aka Byrek). The word phyllo in Greek means "leaf".</p>
    <p>Prior to baking you will layer the thin pieces on top of one another. This creates a flaky texture and crunch unlike any other dough. Do not be swayed by those store bought "puff pastry" doughs. Phyllo is the OG and is much tastier, if I do say so myself.</p>
     <p><h1>Ingredients</h1></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>4 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (approx.)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>3/4 pound of melted butter</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h1>Steps</h1></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, and water into a bowl to form the dough</li>
        <li>Knead until dough is smooth</li>
        <li>Flour dough and cover for 15 mins</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half and cut one half into 12 small pieces</li>
        <li>Roll into 6-inch circles and butter each one</li>
        <li>Stack each on top of the other; do not butter the top circle</li> 
        <li>Cover with wax paper and refrigerate 15 mins</li>
        <li>Repeat the method above with the other half of the dough</li>
        <li>Once first half has been refrigerated, roll to fit 15 or 18 inch round pan, which has been greased generously with melted butter</li>
        <li>Spread filling evenly. See <a href="byrek-me-spinaq.html">Byrek Me Spinaq</a> or <a href="byrek-me-arme.html">Byrek Me Arme</a></li>
        <li>Roll out second dough stack, larger than the first and cover the filling</li>
        <li>Seal the edges by rolling over or under and sprinkle the top generously with the remaining melted butter</li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees for approximately 45 mins or until bottom and top crusts are golden brown</li>
    </ol></p>
